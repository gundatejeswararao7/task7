This project provides a clear, step-by-step process for performing a browser extension security audit to help maintain privacy, performance, and overall security while browsing. The procedure involves opening the browser’s extension manager, carefully reviewing all installed extensions, and checking their permissions and user reviews to verify legitimacy. Unused or suspicious extensions are identified and either disabled or fully removed to prevent potential risks. After cleanup, the browser is restarted to confirm performance improvements and ensure no unwanted behaviors remain. The guide also highlights how malicious extensions can harm users by stealing data, injecting ads, redirecting traffic, or tracking online activity. Finally, it emphasizes documenting all actions taken—including details of removed extensions—to maintain a security record and support ongoing safe browsing practices.
